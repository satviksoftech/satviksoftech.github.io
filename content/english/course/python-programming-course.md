about: "This is the python course which will help you to kick start your career as a software developer. In this course we teach the fundamentals of computer programming through python programming language. You will learn to think logically and improve your problem solving skills, thanks to our revolutionary LEARN WITH LIVE CODING approach. We begin with representing and storing data using python data types and variables and gradually learn how to use python's build in data structures like lists, tuples, dictionaryies etc. Along the way we will solve many puzzles and also understand object oriented programming concepts. We also cover data analysis with numpy, matplotlib, seaborne, pandas. To summarize, this python coding class will take you from an absolute noob to a good developer within a month."
