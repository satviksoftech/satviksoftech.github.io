### About Course
Data structures and algorithms is core computer science subject. This course lays down strong foundation for quantified analysis of algorithm performance and also helps in getting optimal solutions to problems in computer science.

A computer scientist is one who is able to not only come up with programmatic solutions to problems but also analyze the solution got and quantify its efficiency in terms of time and space. This course is the one which helps students grow from a coder to a computer scientist. In this course the students learn how to come up with optimal solutions to problems and quantify the efficiency of their solution. Students also learn to compare algorithms and understand space/time tradeoff. The students also learn how to implement popular data structures in C and understand their real world usage.

### Topics Covered
* Fast recap of C programming language
* Stacks, Queues, List, Trees, Hash Tables
* Algorithm complexity evaluation
* Popular problem solving strategies Divide and conquer, Branch and bound etc.
