### About Course
Javascript is currently the most popular programming language in the world. This course centers around JavaScript to build interactive web applications.

In this multi-faceted course we teach the fundamentals of web development in the javascript ecosystem. The course starts with concepts of HTTP, web designing, web page building, etc. and gradually moves into javascript. Here we will learn how javascript can be used to enhance interactivity on the front-end and also persist data in a database in the backend with the help of NodeJS and MySQL. The course is action packed with tons of interesting examples, games and assignments which are hand picked to stimulate logical and creative thinking in students.

To summarize, this web development course lays strong foundation to become a full stack developer in later course.
